# Lisp Scripts
Designated repository of my various common lisp and elisp scripts.

The following setup may be required for you to run any of the scripts:
* **Editor:** Emacs
* **Repl:** SLIME
* **Implementation:** sbcl
* **Package manager:** quicklisp

## Running
Most of these have their functionality defined entirely within one main function which has no parameters, all you have to do is run it:
```
REPL> (main)
```
And you should get the desired output.
